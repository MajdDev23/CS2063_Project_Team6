This project is an app for tracking user tasks. The app uses plants as "timers" for each task, as the time goes, the plant withers. Users can create sub-tasks which allow them to rehydrate their plant, essentially adding more time to their timer every time they complete a sub-task. 

This project is programmed using Kotlin and the Android Studio v.2024.1.1 Patch 2
