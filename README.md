CS2063 Group Project Team 6: Plant Pal 

This GitHub repository includes the app worked on by members of Team 6.

The correct file which includes the app is "PlantPal2" 

This app is a basic task manager app, which allows the user to create tasks using a calendar and a timer to assign due dates. 

Issues in the app include: 

the plant withering. The code to try and get the plant to wither is included within the working code but does not work.  
We do know that the plant appears on the Home Screen even when no task is currently active. We could not get either of those things working. 
Additionally, our timer for due dates seems to only be accurate with one task. If the user creates multiple tasks each with a timer, 
the timer gets does not function as intended. And it sounds the alarm at different times than what the user set.  

Completed features include: 

Creating tasks  
A calendar to choose the due date for a task, 
A timer that goes off once the due date has been reached,  
Checking tasks off to know which you’ve finished, 
A button to delete all checked tasks, 
Subtask creation, 
Linking subtasks to a main task, 
Deleting subtasks by swiping (touch gesture – substantial functionality).
